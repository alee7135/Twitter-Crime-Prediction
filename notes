Goal
-What is the ultimate goal of such an application? Is it to identify “unexpected” hotspots or crimes or is it to verify “expected” crime spots? I’d say the typical expected crime spots are covered and don’t need any attention. What are the types of crimes which do require more attention are harder to predict with more traditional KDE methods?
-I imagine that crimes reported on Twitter would be much different than crimes reported from Police database. We could create another KDE feature for crimes reported on Twitter.
-I think the value in Twitter is finding those special cases of crazy teens going nuts. Those are needles in a haystack but could potentially save lives if immediate action is taken. 

Time
-If we use Twitter to predict crime, what is the time we use? Do we expect the tweets to predict the same day or the following week? Even if a tweet was correlated with a crime, how can we be sure that it was a causal relationship? Caveat: We have to make sure that tweets timestamps occur strictly before a crime event.
-How do we account or incorporate crime pattern variation across time of day and day of week? Do special holidays add any value?

Spatial
-How do we aggregate the tweets by crime location? I think we set a radius for each crime so perhaps a single crime was predicted by multiple tweets. Later for prediction, we can run a spatial interpolation over our crime point locations.
-What is a good spatial boundary? I think census tracts because they make most sense as they distinguish natural neighborhood boundaries
-It is not only the tweets that are within close vicinity of the crime location which is valuable information but also tweets which are not geotagged but mention or reference a particular crime location or location (if we are predicting).

Crime—> Tweet
-What about instead of tweets—> crime, it was crime —> tweet ? This wouldn’t be considered prediction anymore but could we somehow leverage this information? Perhaps people who report crimes can tell us where crimes are more probable or the volume of after-tweets could say something about future crimes.

Sampling
-How to deal with uneven tweet samples per crime location? We are more certain about crime if there are 100 tweets supporting burglary vs a single tweet. This is again a problem of spatial aggregation because some census tracts will have many samples while others only a few. I think this is okay because we are using a probabilistic model.

Modeling
-Use topic modeling to create topics (features) for the machine learning model. This is unsupervised learning because we are clustering words in documents into topics.
-Could further investigate dependencies between tweets because perhaps a tweet about potential crime that was either retweeted or responded, down voted, whatever a lot will be more predictive of a crime.
-Distance to key landmarks like schools, stadiums, parks, beaches
-Emojis have a lot of hidden meaning, so trying to capture that information is important like guns, alcohol, drugs.
